The analysis was further processed using [mention any tools or libraries used for additional analysis, e.g., Microsoft Excel, Python pandas, etc.].

## How to Run the MySQL Workbench Code

To reproduce the analysis, follow the steps below:

1. Install MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL database.

2. Open the `Working.sql` files in MySQL Workbench.

3. Execute the SQL queries in the mentioned order to retrieve and preprocess the data.
